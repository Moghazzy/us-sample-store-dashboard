# us-sample-store-dashboard
I‚Äôm excited to share a project that I recently worked on during my internship with Uneeq‚Äîan interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing sales, profit, and product performance for a fictional US Super Store. As I built this dashboard, I was able to uncover trends, identify challenges, and visualize the story behind the numbers.

üîç Let me walk you through the insights:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Key Performance Metrics:
At the top of the dashboard, I placed the KPI cards showing the most crucial metrics:

23K Orders, $1.36M Sales, and $164K Profit across 3 main categories‚ÄîFurniture, Technology, and Office Supplies. These headline figures immediately show how the store is performing.
But what‚Äôs behind these numbers? Let‚Äôs dive deeper...

2Ô∏è‚É£ States with Negative Profit:
One of the most eye-opening discoveries was a significant number of states showing negative profit. In particular, Texas stood out with a loss of $81.1K. This led me to ask: what‚Äôs happening in these states? Could it be higher shipping costs, ineffective promotions, or a misalignment between sales and profit margins?

Understanding where we‚Äôre losing money is just as important as knowing where we‚Äôre making it.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Top Sales States:
On the flip side, states like California and New York are pulling in strong sales numbers‚Äî$290.37K and $223.65K, respectively. By visualizing this data, I was able to pinpoint the regions driving the bulk of revenue. This offers an opportunity to replicate successful strategies in lower-performing regions.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Profit by Category and Segment:
I also analyzed performance by product category and customer segment:

Technology is leading the way with 44.61% of total profit, while Office Supplies is lagging behind at 19.37%. Interestingly, the Consumer segment generates the most profit, accounting for 51.48% of total earnings.
This insight tells us where we should focus future marketing efforts and product development.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Shipping Methods and Segments:
The dashboard also includes insights into shipping methods. Here, I found that customers opting for Second Class and Standard Class shipping had similar profit margins, but First Class shipping seemed to perform better in specific regions, which is something to explore further.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Sub-Category Profit Analysis:
Drilling down into product performance, I could see that certain sub-categories, such as Copiers and Phones, were far outperforming others in terms of profit. On the other hand, Tables and Bookcases seemed to underperform.

This level of analysis allows decision-makers to focus on improving underperforming categories or investing more in high-performing ones.

üé® Building the Dashboard:
Creating this dashboard involved leveraging Power BI‚Äôs dynamic visualizations‚Äîincluding bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs‚Äîto present insights in an easy-to-understand format. With interactive filters, users can explore data by state, category, shipping method, or customer segment, giving them the ability to dig deeper into the metrics that matter most to them.

Through this project, I not only improved my technical skills in data analysis and business intelligence but also learned how to extract key insights from complex data and tell the story behind the numbers. This experience has given me a greater appreciation for the power of data-driven decision-making.

üí° Key Tools and Skills Used:

Power BI for data visualization
Data storytelling and analysis
Business Intelligence and reporting
I would love to hear your thoughts on this dashboard and any feedback you might have! Let‚Äôs connect and discuss the stories hidden in your data.
